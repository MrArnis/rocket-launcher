# Rocket Launcher (Not explosive)

Rocket Launcher is a program which scans your pc for the Bakkesmod and Rocket League and launches both of them. This is for the lazy people who don't want to click Bakkesmod before launching Rocket League. I made this due to my Bakkesmod auto-launch not working.


## Features

- No Setup Required
- Optimized
- Doesn't explode unlike a conventional rocket launcher
