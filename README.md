# rocket-launcher
A program that launches BakkesMod for you and when it is done launching, launches Rocket League automatically

To run:

Make sure Rocket Launcher.py and Config.ini are in the same folder or destination.
Then you can simply run "Rocket Launcher.py" and the software will do the rest for you.

Please note: The software may be slow on the first launch but after that it's a lot faster. You will also require to have Rocket League as a desktop shortcut for this program to work.
